# SQL-Database-Tracker

## Description

Started this challenge to accomplish a successful cms employee database. Although I may have fell short in implementing some areas of the cms interface adding to the database. I learned how SQL worked with their schemas, foreign keys, and creating seeds.

## User Story

```md
AS A business owner
I WANT to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
SO THAT I can organize and plan my business
```

## Installation

Need to npm install packages for mysql2, inquirer @8.2.4, and console.table. Here are documentation links to install:
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer/v/8.2.4 
- https://www.npmjs.com/package/console.table

## Usage
When user starts the inquirer prompt then they're able to access database prompt questions. You are able to view all employees, the departments, and roles. When prompted to adding an employee you can input the name, role, and department id but when finished there's a bug not adding into the database.

- Start the inquirer prompt with node server.js
